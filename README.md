# Phonebook Application

This is a simple phonebook application that allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with separate files for each component.

## Features

1. **Add and Edit Contacts**

   - A section with two text inputs (Name and Phone) and a button for adding or editing contacts.
     - New contacts can be added by clicking the "Add Contact" button or by pressing the Enter key when the focus is on the "Phone Number" input.
     - If an existing contact is being edited, the "Add Contact" button will change into "Edit Contact" and will update the existing contact information in the phonebook.

2. **Contact List Table**
   - A section that contains a table with four columns: Name, Phone, Edit, and Delete.
     - Displays all the contacts added to the list.
     - The "Edit" button allows you to update the selected contact's information.
     - The "Delete" button removes the selected contact from the list.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the phonebook.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that handles the styling of the application.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the phonebook's functionality.
